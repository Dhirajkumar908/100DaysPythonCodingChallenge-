# Day 50! Boy, you are smashing this 100 days! ðŸŽŠ To celebrate, here's a project for you.

# Your idea storage system should:

# Prompt the user to add an idea, or load a random one.
# Choosing 'Add an idea' results in:
# A prompt for the user to input their idea.
# Add the idea to a text file called 'my.ideas'.
# Add the idea in append mode, with every new idea on a brand new line.
# Choosing 'Load random' results in:
# Load the list of ideas.
# Choose one at random.
# Display it on screen for a few seconds.
# Return to the menu.

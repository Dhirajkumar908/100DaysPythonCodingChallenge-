#Day 4 Challenge
#Ask your users to list a bunch of information about them: things they like, things they hate, names of family and friends... it's up to you how many and what kinds of things you pick. Keep it wacky!
# Now construct your story - it can be about anything you want, but must use the variables you've created in step 1.
#Make sure to only work one paragraph at a time. Otherwise things could get a bit messy.

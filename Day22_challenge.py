ğŸ‘‰ Day 22 Challenge
Copy and paste your code from Day 18.

We are going to make a change to this project:

Make the number generator completely random between 1 and 1,000,000. Now, the game will always have the user guess a random number each time (now the user can't cheat...)

Totally Random One-Million-to-One
What is your guess?: 500000
Too low
What is your guess?: 750000
Too high
What is your guess?: 600000
Too low
What is your guess?: 650000
Correct!
It took you 4 guesses to get the number correct.
Click 'run' to try again with a different number.
